Define key metrics to measure performance and outcomes:
 - Patient count.
 - Average length of stay.
 - Patient recovery rates.
 - Cost per treatment.
 - Patient satisfaction scores.

### 3. Power BI Features Utilized
Power BI provides robust features to create insightful dashboards:
 - Interactive Dashboards: Bar charts, line graphs, and heatmaps to visualize metrics like bed occupancy and treatment effectiveness.
 - Forecasting: Predict trends in patient inflow or medical staff requirements using Power BI's forecasting capabilities.
 - KPI Indicators: Monitor progress toward healthcare targets like reducing readmission rates.

## Actionable Insights
The dashboard provides insights for immediate action:
 - Optimize Resource Allocation: Identify underutilized resources or overburdened departments.
 - Reduce Readmission Rates: Address patterns that lead to readmissions.
 - Improve Patient Satisfaction: Monitor feedback trends to tailor services.
